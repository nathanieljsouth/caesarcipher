<h1>Making the app better</h1>

<p>A few thoughts I had to make the app even better are listed here.</p>
    
<p>While the 'brute force' approach is useful to decrypt messages, it relies on the user recognising which result is correct.  I'd like to integrate with a spell-checker to detect if a result is English (or maybe even allow different languages to be selected!) </p>
    
<p>My icon image (shown below) got me thinking about using a circular display to show the 'map' of the cipher using a specific key value.  I could do this by using 25 images but I'd like to try and figure out how to build the circular display in code (this could be hard though!)</p>

<p>The Caesar Cipher doesn't encrypt spaces so the lengths of words can easily be seen even after encryption.  I think making a change to the cipher so spaces are also encrypted would be a good idea.</p>

<p>I discovered that the 'onchange' event only fires for the spin button after the user clicks somewhere else if they type a value in.  This works okay but it's a little annoying and would be good to fix.</p>
